# 🛠️ Maintenance Reminder with SharePoint, Adaptive Cards & Power Automate

## 📌 Overview
This project automates **maintenance reminders** for laboratory instruments using:
- **SharePoint Online** – stores maintenance schedules and metadata  
- **Power Automate Cloud Flows** – sends notifications and updates records  
- **Adaptive Cards in Microsoft Teams** – allows users to assign and complete maintenance tasks directly  

The system ensures:
- Automated reminders before due dates (configurable per device)  
- Notifications sent directly to the assigned person in Teams  
- One-click actions: **Assign to me** or **Mark as done**  
- Automatic updates of SharePoint fields (`Status`, `AssignedTo`, `LastMaintenance`, `NextDueDate`)
