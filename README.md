This project provides a **maintenance reminder solution** based on  
- **SharePoint List** (as central data source)  
- **Power Automate Flows** (logic + notifications)

##  Power Automate Flows
## Flows Overview
- ⚙️ [Flow 1 – Reminder Flow](docs/setup-guide.md#flow-1)
- 🔁 [Flow 2 – Follow-up Flow](docs/setup-guide.md#flow-2)
### Flow 1 – Maintenance Reminder
- **Trigger:** Scheduled (daily)  
- **Logic:**
  1. Get items from SharePoint  
  2. Filter: `Status = Open` and `DaysLeft <= ReminderThreshold`  
  3. Send Adaptive Card in Teams (`AssignedTo`)  
  4. Wait for response  
  5. Update SharePoint:  
     - If **Assign to me** → `AssignedTo = responder`, `Status = In Progress`  
     - If **Mark as done** → `Status = Done`, `LastMaintenance = Today()`, recalc `NextDueDate`  

### Flow 2 – Follow-up after Assignment
- **Trigger:** Response from Flow 1 (*Assign to me*)  
- **Logic:**
  1. Send follow-up Adaptive Card (only **Mark as done**)  
  2. On completion → update SharePoint `Status = Done`, update maintenance dates

## 📂 Repository Structure

## 📂 Adaptive Cards
- [`adaptive-cards/reminder-card.json`](adaptive-cards/reminder-card.json) – Card with "Assign to me" + "Mark as done"  
- [`adaptive-cards/followup-card.json`](adaptive-cards/followup-card.json) – Card with only "Mark as done"  

---

## Setup Guide
1. Create SharePoint List based on schema above  
2. Import Power Automate flows from `/flows/`  
3. Adjust SharePoint connection & Teams channel in flows  
4. Upload Adaptive Card JSON from `/adaptive-cards/` into the flow actions  
5. Test with sample data  

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- **No reminder triggered?** → Check calculated `DaysLeft` column in SharePoint  
- **Card not showing in Teams?** → Ensure Adaptive Card JSON is valid (use [Adaptive Card Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/))  
- **Date not updating?** → Verify that `LastMaintenance` and `NextDueDate` are recalculated correctly in Flow
