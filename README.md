##  Power Automate Flows
## Flows Overview
- ‚öôÔ∏è [Flow 1 ‚Äì Reminder Flow](docs/setup-guide.md#flow-1)
- üîÅ [Flow 2 ‚Äì Follow-up Flow](docs/setup-guide.md#flow-2)
### Flow 1 ‚Äì Maintenance Reminder
- **Trigger:** Scheduled (daily)  
- **Logic:**
  1. Get items from SharePoint  
  2. Filter: `Status = Open` and `DaysLeft <= ReminderThreshold`  
  3. Send Adaptive Card in Teams (`AssignedTo`)  
  4. Wait for response  
  5. Update SharePoint:  
     - If **Assign to me** ‚Üí `AssignedTo = responder`, `Status = In Progress`  
     - If **Mark as done** ‚Üí `Status = Done`, `LastMaintenance = Today()`, recalc `NextDueDate`  

### Flow 2 ‚Äì Follow-up after Assignment
- **Trigger:** Response from Flow 1 (*Assign to me*)  
- **Logic:**
  1. Send follow-up Adaptive Card (only **Mark as done**)  
  2. On completion ‚Üí update SharePoint `Status = Done`, update maintenance dates

## üìÇ Adaptive Cards
- [`adaptive-cards/reminder-card.json`](adaptive-cards/reminder-card.json) ‚Äì Card with "Assign to me" + "Mark as done"  
- [`adaptive-cards/followup-card.json`](adaptive-cards/followup-card.json) ‚Äì Card with only "Mark as done"

## Setup Guide
1. Create SharePoint List based on schema above  
2. Import Power Automate flows from `/flows/`  
3. Adjust SharePoint connection & Teams channel in flows  
4. Upload Adaptive Card JSON from `/adaptive-cards/` into the flow actions  
5. Test with sample data

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **No reminder triggered?** ‚Üí Check calculated `DaysLeft` column in SharePoint  
- **Card not showing in Teams?** ‚Üí Ensure Adaptive Card JSON is valid (use [Adaptive Card Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/))  
- **Date not updating?** ‚Üí Verify that `LastMaintenance` and `NextDueDate` are recalculated correctly in Flow
